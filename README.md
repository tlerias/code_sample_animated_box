Code Sample: Animation of a Box with confetti

This is an animation that I built using CSS/Fela.
I chose this as a code sample because it displays my ability to take a static SVG and an animation video and turn it into
a working CSS Animation component. Though a simple and short animation, there were many moving parts and so I was proud
to be able to bring this design to life.
